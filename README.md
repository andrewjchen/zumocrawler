# zumy
Zumy is a small robot running linux using Pololu's Zumo robot chassis.

## Getting Started
0. Setup the mbed
1. Install linux on the ODROIDs
2. Configure networking (if needed)
3. Install necessary software on host computer and on ODROIDs
4. Configure robots and scripts


### Mbed setup
Use the mbed IDE to deploy the following code to the mbed:

http://mbed.org/users/ajc/code/RPC_Serial/


###Linux Installation
Any flavor of linux should work, but ubuntu is recommended.

### Networking
The host computer connects to the access point normally.
The ODROIDs are configured using manual networking, defined under /etc/network/interfaces.

Example settings:

```sh
# /etc/network/interfaces
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
#auto eth0
# iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan1
iface wlan1 inet static
address 192.168.1.122
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8
wpa-ssid fearing-robonet
wpa-psk fearingrobonet
```

N.B: wireless adapters are given unique interface names (ie. wlan0, wlan1) based on their MAC addresses, so once the boards are configured, the wireless adapters cannot be arbitrarily swapped.

### Installing Software

Required Software:
* psutil 2.1.1
* lcm
* pygame
* pyserial
* rsync
* ssh

##### On Desktop Ubuntu (host computer)
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python-psutil python-pygame python-serial rsync ssh

```

##### On the ODROID running Ubuntu
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-pygame python-serial rsync ssh
$ sudo pip install psutil --upgrade

```

##### LCM installation:

https://code.google.com/p/lcm/wiki/BuildInstructions.

Be sure to copy lcm.jar into the repo to take advantage of packet introspection with lcm-spy.

When using more than one network interface, (ie. eth0 and wlan0), be sure to manually specify the route for the udp multicast address.
For example:
```sh
ajc@rektjc:~$ route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         10.10.64.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0
10.10.64.0      *               255.255.252.0   U     2      0        0 wlan0
10.42.0.0       *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth0
link-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     2      0        0 wlan2
192.168.56.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 vboxnet0
239.255.76.67   *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 wlan2
```

##### Setting your route in network manager:

Right click Network Manager Applet > Edit Connections > Wireless > fearing-robonet > IPv4 Settings > Routes... > Add "Address"=239.255.76.67, "Netmask"=255.255.255.255, leave "Gateway" and "Metric" blank.
"Use this connection only for resources on its network" works if you want to connect to the internet with another interface.


### Configuration

Configuration defines what nodes are autostarted, and how the zumocrawlers address themselves in python.

##### Serial device (mbed) permissions
```sh
$ sudo gpasswd -a odroid dialout
```

##### Zumocrawler ID file
is defined in /home/odroid/zc_id. 
The contents of this file become the conventional prefix for all data channels pertaining to the robot.

Example configuration:
```sh
$ echo '/001' > ~/zc_id
```


##### Autostart
add the desired autostart script to /etc/rc.local:

```sh
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.
/home/odroid/zumocrawler/start_scripts/odroid_init.sh
exit 0
```

## Default Driving Code
* run joy_pub.py on host computer
* default autostarts should drive the zumocrawler
* run lcm_spy.sh to see what's going on

## Development

##### Deploy your repo to the robot via network:

```sh
zumocrawler$ sh admin_scripts/deploy.sh
```
You will need to have added your ssh key to the ODROID:
```sh
$ ssh-keygen #if you do not have an existing key
$ ssh-copy-id odroid@192.168.1.122
```

##### Adding additional scripts:
edit the startup script, start_scripts/odroid_init.sh


##### Adding an LCM type
add the type to the types/ directory. and run 
```sh 
./gen_types.sh
```

##### LCM packet debugging
```sh
./lcm_spy.sh
```

##### Using the ODROID serial root console:
use Minicom with these settings:
```sh
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | A -    Serial Device      : /dev/ttyUSB0                              |
    | B - Lockfile Location     : /var/lock                                 |
    | C -   Callin Program      :                                           |
    | D -  Callout Program      :                                           |
    | E -    Bps/Par/Bits       : 115200 8N1                                |
    | F - Hardware Flow Control : No                                       |
    | G - Software Flow Control : No                                        |
    |                                                                       |
    |    Change which setting?                                              |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
Run minicom:
```sh
$ minicom --device=/dev/ttyUSB0
```
